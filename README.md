# Pokémon Emerald

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald with various patches applied to update game mechanics.

## Major changes

- Updates moves, abilities and mechanics (DizzyEgg's battle engine upgrade)
- Adds items from newer generations (DizzyEgg's item expansion)
- Updates pokemon movesets (level up, egg)
- Updates breeding mechanics
- Updates TMs/HMs to OrAs TMs/HMs
- Replaces the battle style setting with a difficulty setting (SHIFT -> EASY, SET -> NORMAL and a new setting HARD, which equals SET but also scales trainer Pokémon levels with your own)
- Adds a chance for wild double battles (using sweet scent causes wild encounters to always be double battles)
- Adds hidden abilities (Pokémon with HA can be found in the safari zone or rarely in wild double battles)
- Updates EXP mechanics
- (Almost) all Pokémon can be caught

- When buying more than 19 Poké Balls, you're given Premier Balls based on the amount of balls you bought instead of only one

- All legendary and gifted Pokémon have a minimum of 3 perfect IVs
